## Founder of Superphysics and Pantrypoints

I founded [Superphysics](https://superphysics.org), as well as [Pantrypoints](https://pantrypoints.com), which implements Economic Superphysics.

In my free time, I offer to move Wordpress sites into Static Sites via the Jamstack which costs far cheaper to maintain as they do not require databases. This also makes them [better for the planet](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/static-sites-fight-climate-change/).
